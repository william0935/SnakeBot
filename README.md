# SnakeBot

A bot to beat the Snake game.

## Description

The Snake Game is one that tests people's quick thinking and reflexes, so I decided to use Python libraries to create a bot to beat the game.

The bot isn't finished at the moment, there are still improvements to be made(mainly making it faster).

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
There are no necessary pre-installations for the program.

### Executing program
To run the program, run the snakeBot.py file.
